# ScalaR
Internal Scala DSL built to be a subset of the R programming langauage. 
It uses a type safe vector data structure supporting Numerical, Logical, and Character (numbers, booleans, and strings)
types, in addition to the special NA type, which represents the absence of value, and important concept for a statistical language. Using this vector structure as a backbone, we also present data frames, which are tabulated data stores which are incredibly useful and convenient for working with data. Finally, we implement basic plotting functionality through the WISP library.
